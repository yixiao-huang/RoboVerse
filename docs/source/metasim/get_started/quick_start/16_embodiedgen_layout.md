In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to quickly load a layout scene generated by EmbodiedGen into MetaSim.

The LayoutGen module in [EmbodiedGen](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen) enables users to generate interactive 3D scenes directly from natural language task descriptions. Given a high-level description (e.g., “a franka robot arm grasping different styles of cups”), LayoutGen automatically creates a complete simulation-ready environment, including:
- Procedural generation of sim-ready 3D object assets
- Physically plausible object placement and scene layout
- Consideration of robot reachability, graspability, and task constraints

The generated assets are exported in a universal format that supports multiple simulators (e.g., SAPIEN, Isaac Sim, MuJoCo, PyBullet, Genesis, Isaac Gym).

Below is an example showing how to load a LayoutGen generated scene in RoboVerse. You can download more scenes from example_layouts folder under [hf datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGenData) or use [EmbodiedGen](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen) to generate by yourself.

For more information on generating layout scenes, please refer to the [EmbodiedGen-LayoutGen documentation](https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen#%EF%B8%8F-layoutinteractive-3d-worlds-generation).


## Common Usage
```bash
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim <simulator>
```

In headless mode:
```bash
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim isaacsim --headless
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim isaacgym --headless
MUJOCO_GL=egl python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim mujoco --headless
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim genesis --headless
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim sapien3 --headless
python get_started/16_embodiedgen_layout.py  --sim pybullet --headless
```

You will get the following result:
